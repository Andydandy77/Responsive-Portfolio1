        <p class ="textright">Hello there! My name is Dave Anderson and welcome to my portfolio page.
            I graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical
            Engineering. I have worked in the semiconductor industry with Cypress Semiconductor for the last year as an 
            Electrical Design Engineer, focusing on Analog IC design. Recently, however, I feel drawn to the possiblities of innovation
            in software and web development.</p>
            
            <p>I also have a strong interest in learning more about deep learning, neural networks and artificial intelligence.
            This displays several of my strongest projects showcasing my skills. I also enjoy hiking, climbing, cooking, playing guitar, 
            piano, bass, drums and singing. My secret passion is to become a indie rockstar.
        </p>
