        <p class ="textright">Transitioning from the semiconductor industry with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering and a strong 
            background in object oriented programming, I aim to become a software engineer focusing in full stack development and data analytics.
             As a passionate and unrelenting student, I currently am enrolled in UW’s Coding Bootcamp, learning the MERN development stack,
              all while working as a full time electrical engineer. I quickly pick up new algorithm concepts  and do not hesitate to apply them in projects.
               In the next coming years I strive to expand into machine learning development, for I believe it will be the single most important field in the software industry. 
               This website displays several of my strongest projects showcasing the newest technologies I have learned.
